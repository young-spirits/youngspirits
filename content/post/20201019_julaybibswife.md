# Julaybib's Wife



###### 		I believe, if people could have ever understood we are all parts of an undivided totality, particularly men-women and any other discrimination could never exist. I want to address discrimination should not be a part of anything related to our belief system. People, who can see into where we come from and where we are heading, are compassionate. They have compassion for the entire universe, for the human as a core of universe and the essence of themselves. People who can turn into themselves, can find every answer inside their heart and mind know that when they communicate with anyone, the one's gender is not an issue for their response. However not only but mostly in Eastern countries and specifically in Muslim world, patriarchy is a crystal-clear fact(1). We, unfortunately, have been hearing tons and kinds of abuse, violence and crimes in yesterday’s, today’s and possibly will hear in the future's world. Now, we are in a fear of women murder whenever we do a basic search in news or social media. 

​		The offenders were once an innocent who have never opened their mind to anyone with transparency of their thoughts. They become easily a man who has no mercy and sees the power in himself with a patriarchal subconscious. It can be attached with a social, a cultural and a religionary effect. In contrast, history tells us studiously conserved stories. When Omar ibn el-Khattab (ra) who is one of the most powerful and influenced companion and second caliph announced some restriction about bride wealth, an objection with a support of verse from Quran came from a women in the crowd.(2) When women can readily make an objection or express themselves easily, the answerers were the very first acceptors of Islam. I found a touching story about young couple who might not get married if social context didn't change after Islam. Julaybib is one of the young Muslim men in Madinah who is known by his inappropriate talks or jokes among women before brighting his heart with Islam(3). After Prophet Muhammad (sav) kindly and curatively answered his questions and pray for him, Julaybib turned into a gentle, well-behaved and polite man by asking frankly and learning empathy. His wife got proposal directly from Prophet Muhammad (sav) for the marriage with Julaybib. Her family didn't want this marriage because of his reputation. However, young lady politely objected his father by complete trust of Prophet Muhammad (sav) (4), her family let them to get married. 

​		By the time passes, it seems that Islamic geography do not live like the succesors. This girl, whose name is unknown, is still alive not because of name, lineage, race, physical appearance, social status, but her 'attitude' in that period of time not too far from when a father has a baby girl he feels shame even further baby girls have been buried. She protested her father when he decided not to marry her. She is one of the voices of women who are still dominated by men in today's world. She gave a precious example of how women can say her opinion and can change the situation even if her future is decided without asking herself. She made her choice and accepted the proposal. She had known what changed Julaybib and she had a full of trust. Thus, her objection shows absolute respect to the Prophet Muhammad (sav) who wanted her to marry with Julaybib. The fact is her marriage is one of the best story because of her attitude to illuminate about 'Women’s Position In Islam' while we don’t even know her name. Stories of women is Islamic history shows us completely different social and ethical responsibilities of the society than today.
