## Responsibilities and selflessness  

It was a rather uncrowded morning at the airport. People were just getting over the pandemic and travel was picking up. There were no lineups as there used to be, so it was not long before he put his carry on into the bin, sat down on his seat and buckle up. The plane was mostly empty, passengers were scattered around the seats. He could see a mother and her probably 4-year-old son next to him on the other side of the aisle. The child being a child, his mother was rushing to attend to all his nuisance, trying to keep things under control, still smiling.

After the doors were closed and the plane left the gate, the flight attendants lined up in the corridor and started their routine pre-flight announcements.

*“ ….. should the cabin experience sudden pressure loss, stay calm and listen for instructions from the cabin crew. Oxygen masks will drop down from above your seat. Place the mask over your mouth and nose, like this. Pull the strap to tighten it. If you are traveling with children, make sure that your own mask is on first before helping your children. In the unlikely event of an …..”*

This part always baffled him. He looked at the mother and child again, observed how she was obsessed with the boy. He thought, would any mother put the mask on herself before her child? Could she do that? It seemed very unlikely. Mothers and parents are always associated with selflessness about their children. We hear and read stories, news everywhere about the sacrifices they make, how they always put their children before themselves. It is almost a given fact. 

Why do parents do that? How do they do that? One can easily answer with “because a child is the most esteemed and cherished being in a mother’s life so that more than herself!” So, it is natural to act that way.

There was one case that he was pondering about since that morning. “*They give them preference over themselves, even if they too are poor: those who are saved from their own souls’ greed are truly successful.” (59:9)* He was struggling with this verse for a while. It was not the meaning of the verse. It was the event narrated as the raison d’etre for this verse. 

The instance is reported in three of the 6 most trusted collections of Hadith (1) and by one of the most prominent sources, Abu Hurayrah. The central figure in this incident is Abu Talha al-Ansari (2) and it happens circa 1st year (3) after the Prophet (SAW) migrated to Madinah. 

As narrated by Abu Hurayrah, a man came to Rasulullaah (SAW) complaining of severe hunger. Rasulullaah (SAW) then sent a message to his family (to send some food) but received news that there was nothing but water at home. Rasulullaah (SAW) then announced, "Who will host this man tonight and Allah will shower His mercy on him." A man from the Ansar (residents of Madina) volunteered and took the man home, where he said to his wife, "Do you have any food?" She replied, "There is nothing besides the children's food." He said, "Pacify them with something and then put them to sleep when they want their supper. When our guest arrives, put out the lantern and pretend that we are eating."

There were many people in need coming from Makkah with very few belongings to get through at that time. To ease the suffering and to offer people a helping hand, Prophet (SAW) instituted companionships between the newcomer emigrants (Muhajiruun) and the Ansar. The need was immense, where many people shared most of their wealth leaving little to themselves. 

Abu Talha was one of the wealthiest people in Madinah at that time. He was the owner of many gardens and orchards with water wells within. However, by the circumstances in the narrative it seems that even he did not have much to offer to his family, let alone others. He must have been among the most generous who held their brothers and sisters at a greater regard than himself to the extent that he was left with little to survive. 

“True” or “pure” altruism or selflessness, is described as doing something for another person and getting absolutely nothing in return. The intriguing part in this anecdote is, Abu Talha does not only prefer others to himself in well-being, he takes over all the responsibility, burden and obligation of his family and his children following his action . Mind bogglingly, he is not alone, and is joined by his wife, Ummu Suleym (4) in doing so, when a mother is expected to favor her children before anything. Instead, Ummu Suleym takes over the scene and smoothly executes the plan. This family works together to pass the last food they have to someone in need, absorb all the stress and anxiety that comes along and expect absolutely nothing as a payback. 

It felt unsettling, thinking how a mother could reconcile this within. But maybe it was the exact definition of selflessness. Most of the time we invent excuses not to do things that do not benefit us in some way or another. We reflect the essence to other directions so that it does not hit us at the core. It is easy to bring in “responsibility”, and “but” or “although” into the equation and move on. But it takes real courage to grab all and still do what is meant to be done. 

Maybe it was their courage that rewarded this family with a mention in this verse of Qur’an; their being direct in doing good and acting on it. A privilege that would stand forever.

“Maybe”, he thought. He looked at the mother and child again. He turned his head towards the window. It was him and wide-open skies through the window. Everything else was way down below, isolated.
