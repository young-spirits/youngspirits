### The rise of Julaibib

*The ones who watched Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker must remember the conversation between Rey and Nambi Ghima, a young Aki-Aki girl at the Festival of Ancestors on Pasaana. She greeted Rey and offered her a husk necklace as a gesture of welcome and asked her name. After C-3PO translated her Rey's first name, she asked about her family name and Rey responded "Just Rey". Everyone must have noticed the bitter and solitude in Rey's voice when she said "Just Rey".*

 

*When I first heard Julaibib's name, I also wondered "Why just Julaibib"? That didn't sound right, because all the names of Prophet's companions have "bin/binti" or "Ebu/Ummu" in their names, indicating that they belong to a "family". However, Julaibib doesn't have such a name, which suggests his family roots are unknown. Why does it matter if he is an orphan? Unfortunately, the society of his time have trust issues with the people whose lineage is uncertain. How ironic, right? An orphan is already lonely in the world, lacks his/her parents' protection and guidance. And his/her society rejects him/her and does not give a chance to make them feel a part of the society.* 

 

*"This (man) is of me and I am of him." On the other hand, this is how Prophet Mohammed embraces Julaibib. What a powerful statement a leader can make. Who is Prophet Mohammed? He is the messenger of God, living example of Quran and also head of the state. So, what did Julaibib do to become "of Mohammed" ? He was one of his younger companions , who became Muslim short after Prophet Mohammed arrived in Madina. Before his arrival, Julaibib was rejected by the society just because of his lack of lineage and his unusual appearance. Prophet Mohammed welcomed him as he welcomed everybody whoever they are.*

 

*Julaibib found peace in the presence of Prophet Mohammed, but he was young and he had a life to live. However, he had almost no luck to find someone to live his life together because of the stereotypes in the society. If Julaybib gets married with a women coming from a well-respected family, he would be adopted by his people. Probably with this intention, Prophet Mohammed asked a local man (in Madina) if he would be interested in marrying his daughter to Julaibib. The man hesitated for a moment and took some time to respond to Mohammed. He wanted to consult with his wife on this matter. His wife didn't take it lightly because she knew what people think about Julaibib, so she advised his husband to reject Prophet's offer.* 

 

*They didn't even ask their daughter's opinion assuming she was going to refuse to marry Julaibib. Luckily, she overheard her parents' conversation and stopped his father before he leaves the home. She asked her parents if they are going to say no to Prophet just because they give more value to society's stereotypes. She knew that all the efforts Prophet spent all these years had a purpose to destroy the ignorance, stereotypes and discrimination of all kinds. And she believed that Prophet always wants good for his community, so she accepted his offer to marry Juleibib.* 

 

*Her decision probably can be considered as just another example to understand the change happening in Muslim society at that time. Yes, they might have accepted Mohammed as a Messenger of God and become a Muslim but living a life in the steps of Prophet required a change. Most Muslims left their conservative ideas and actions rooted in ignorance after they chose Islam. They not only embraced a new faith but also accepted the change necessary to build a healthy society. In that sense, Juleibib's wife set an example of anti-discrimination attitude by choosing to marry Juleibib regardless of his unusual appearance and unk nown family roots, despite the society's stereotypes.* 

 

*A marriage based on love and respect also brought happiness to Juleibib and his wife. He spent rest of his short life in his peaceful home with his wife and worked alongside Prophet Mohammed to make a change in the society. When he was born, he was just "Juleibib", but after Prophet Mohammed believed in him and his value, he rose up as "of Mohammed" just like Rey rose up as a "Skywalker" after she realized who really believed in who she really was.*
